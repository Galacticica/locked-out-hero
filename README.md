## What Is Lock Out Hero?


## How To Use Our Demo
In the development stage, our program runs off of a uv environment. 

In the terminal, run the command ```uv run py manage.py runserver```
Then control click the url ```http://127.0.0.1:8000```

### Demo Login Info
    Username:jimmy.john
        This would be the standard username for the school website accounts. For us it's FirstName.LastName

    Password: freakyfastfood
        This is the same password that is used for all school login accounts by default, or it can be set separately

Once logged in, select the building you want to gain access to.
Once clicking the call for help button, it will show a screen, and at that point the door would unlock.
It also logs the usage in our database.
